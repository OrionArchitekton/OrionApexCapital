Markets have rhythms; operators need cadences. We align both so attention is spent where payoff is highest.

## Weekly Frame
- **Monday:** Plan week; mark levels; define *no-trade* zones.
- **Mid-Week:** Performance review -- was it setup quality or execution?
- **Friday:** Close-out log; pick one improvement for next week.

## Daily Blocks
- **Prep (30-45m):** Bias read, levels, scenarios.
- **Execute (1-3h windows):** Only during pre-chosen sessions.
- **Debrief (15m):** Log decision quality; screenshot key moments.

## Energy Rules
- Fixed start/stop times.
- No "revenge work" after losses.
- Sleep, steps, and hydration are tracked like KPIs.

### Review Prompts
- "What would have made this *obvious*?"
- "Which step felt rushed?"
- "What variable changed that the plan didn't account for?"

> **Edge doesn't shout -- it whispers to the prepared.**
