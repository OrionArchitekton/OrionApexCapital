Markets move in rhythms. Operators need cadences. We align both so attention and energy meet the window where payoff is highest.

## Weekly frame that keeps the desk composed

- **Monday · Map & intention:** Mark structural levels, define no-trade zones, and assign research blocks.
- **Mid-week · Performance audit:** Separate setup quality from execution—was it discipline or the market?
- **Friday · Close and reset:** Archive logs, screenshot key moments, and pick a single focus for next week.

## Daily blocks that anchor flow

- **Prep (30–45 min):** Bias read, key levels, scenario branches.
- **Execute (1–3 hr windows):** Only within pre-selected sessions aligned with liquidity.
- **Debrief (15 min):** Log decision quality, note emotions, store charts for later review.

> **Cadence reminder:** Edge rarely shouts—it whispers to operators who arrive with intention.

## Energy protocols are non-negotiable

- Fixed start/stop times guard sleep and recovery.
- No “revenge work” after losses; shut down screens and process offline.
- Sleep, steps, hydration, and nutrition are tracked like critical KPIs.

### Review prompts to keep the loop honest

1. What would have made this setup *obvious* sooner?
2. Which step felt rushed despite the plan?
3. What variable changed that the playbook didn’t account for?

**Cadence becomes an asset when you script it.** Protect it as fiercely as capital.
