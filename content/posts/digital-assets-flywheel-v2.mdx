We run a **tight compounding loop** for digital assets: **Buy → Improve → Recycle**. The objective is controlled upgrades that unlock durability and multiple ways to win.

## 1 · Buy with intent and clean signals

- **Screening:** Clean domain history, coherent topic graph, zero toxic link baggage.
- **Traffic mix:** Intent beats volume; we prefer diversified channels (search, direct, referral).
- **Monetization fit:** Ads + affiliate + direct offer optionality—avoid single-point fragility.
- **Ops feasibility:** Properties with 60–90 day improvement pathways fit the desk rhythm.

## 2 · Improve with checklists, not heroics

- **Technical:** Core Web Vitals, image compression, cache policy, 404/redirect hygiene.
- **Content:** Map topical authority, prune cannibalization, add missing intent pages.
- **UX / Trust:** Clear navigation, legal/contact coverage, consistent styling, no dark patterns.
- **Revenue:** Lift RPM via placement science; align affiliate CTAs with search intent.

### 30-day upgrade checklist

- Lighthouse ≥ 90 (mobile & desktop).
- Internal linking: pillar ↔ cluster coverage.
- Top 10 pages refreshed with schema, FAQs, and updated CTAs.
- RPM uplift target: +20–40% with documented experiments.

> **Operator mantra:** Systems beat heroics. Run the checklist, log the deltas, repeat.

## 3 · Recycle on our terms

- **Hold:** Cashflow while running quarterly operating reviews.
- **Refi:** Package assets into micro-portfolios with documented track records.
- **Sell:** Realize multiple expansion once growth stabilizes and documentation is complete.

### Operating rhythm

- **Weekly:** One deep improvement and two quick wins.
- **Monthly:** KPI deck (traffic, RPM, revenue mix), issues list, next 30-day bets.

**Principle:** Small, boring improvements compound. Velocity matters more than theatrics.
