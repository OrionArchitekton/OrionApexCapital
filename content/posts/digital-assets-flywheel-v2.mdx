We run a **tight flywheel** for digital assets: **Buy -> Improve -> Recycle**. The objective is not perfection -- it's *controlled, measured upgrades* that unlock durability and multiple ways to win.

## 1) Buy (with Intent)
- **Screening:** Clean domain history, coherent topic graph, no toxic links.
- **Traffic Mix:** Intent > volume; diversify sources (search, direct, referral).
- **Monetization Fit:** Ads + affiliates + direct offers optionality; no single-point fragility.
- **Ops Fit:** Prefer properties with 60-90 day improvement pathways.

## 2) Improve (fast, measurable)
- **Technical:** Core Web Vitals, image compression, cache, 404/redirect hygiene.
- **Content:** Map topical authority; prune cannibalization; add missing intent pages.
- **UX/Trust:** Clear nav, contact/legal, consistent styling, zero dark patterns.
- **Revenue:** RPM lift via ad placement science; affiliate CTAs that match search intent.

**30-Day Upgrade Checklist**
- Lighthouse >= 90 mobile/desktop
- Internal linking: pillar <-> cluster
- Top 10 pages: refresh + schema + FAQs
- RPM uplift target: +20-40%

## 3) Recycle (options, not obligations)
- **Hold:** Cashflow with quarterly ops reviews.
- **Refi:** Package into micro-portfolio with track records.
- **Sell:** Realize multiple expansion once growth flattens.

### Operating Rhythm
- Weekly: one deep improvement + two quick wins.
- Monthly: KPI deck (traffic, RPM, rev mix), issues list, next 30-day bets.

> **Principle:** Small, boring improvements compound. Velocity matters more than theatrics.
