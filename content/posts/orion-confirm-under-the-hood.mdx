## Why "Confirm" Exists

Our insight cadence used to be a scramble: last-minute formatting fixes, mismatched metadata, and the occasional broken embed. "Orion Confirm" is the automation layer that keeps every post on brand and on schedule.

It starts the moment a strategist commits a draft:

- **Linting & MDX validation** run locally with the same rules the production site expects.
- **Content heuristics** score readability, link hygiene, and compliance copy blocks.
- **Image optimization** and alt-text checks make sure creative assets are accessible before merge.

<Callout eyebrow="Guardrails" title="Every post ships with proof" variant="signal">
  The pipeline attaches a JSON summary to each PR: reading time deltas, linter output, and a diff of SEO metadata. If something drifts — font casing, tone words, or missing disclosures — the reviewer sees it instantly.
</Callout>

## Five Stages from Draft to Production

1. **Draft Sync** — Writers commit MDX with frontmatter that includes hero art, CTAs, and disclaimers.
2. **Automated QA** — `confirm check` runs remark/rehype plugins, accessibility tests, and brand token enforcement.
3. **Preview Deploy** — Vercel preview spins up with production config so stakeholders can comment on a real build.
4. **Approval Snapshot** — Confirm snapshots OG images, generates social copy, and stores a signed artifact in KV.
5. **Scheduled Publish** — A simple `confirm publish slug` pushes the post live, updates the sitemap, and pings distribution hooks.

<Callout eyebrow="Automation" title="Compliance stays in the loop" variant="warning">
  Confirm prompts reviewers for disclosure updates when a post references financial performance. The pipeline blocks merge until legal checkboxes are cleared or a waiver is logged.
</Callout>

## Tooling Stack

- **Content layer** — MDX with custom components (`<Callout />`, `<InsightImage />`, interactive metrics)
- **Validation** — remark, rehype, and bespoke brand plugins that enforce casing, glossary usage, and CTA length
- **Artifacts** — Signed JSON stored in Vercel KV so every post has an audit trail
- **Distribution** — Webhooks push to email, LinkedIn, and the internal market monitor once the publish flag flips

<Callout eyebrow="Velocity" title="It feels like magic" variant="success">
  Editors approve in minutes, not hours. The pipeline catches regressions, aligns visuals, and prepares the share assets automatically. Creators stay focused on insight, not formatting.
</Callout>

## What This Means for Partners

When you hand us research, thought leadership, or operation guides, you get:

- **Predictable releases** keyed to your calendar
- **Live previews** that non-technical stakeholders can annotate
- **Brand-safe output** every time, across web, email, and social
