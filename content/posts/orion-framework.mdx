> *Nothing here is financial advice.*

We focus on short-term setups (≤72 hours) across scalp, breakout, and swing categories. **Multi-timeframe confluence** (1H + 4H / D) is mandatory. No confluence, no trade.

## Setup architecture

- **Structure:** Higher-timeframe bias, key levels, and liquidity pockets.
- **Signals:** RSI/MACD slope agreement, EMA200 trend context, and volume impulse thresholds.
- **Volatility:** ATR range sufficient for 2× stop distance inside the time box.

## Risk-first execution protocol

- **Stops:** ATR-based; placed where the idea is invalidated.
- **Reward:** 2:1 minimum risk-to-reward locked at entry.
- **Liquidity filter:** Avoid thin books; ≤0.2% expected slippage for $1k–$3k tickets.
- **Management:** Move stop to breakeven at TP1; trail after verified impulse continuation.

> **Operator mantra:** We trade process, not predictions.

Quantified rules plus operator judgment preserve capital and sustain edge. We run the play because it’s repeatable, not because it’s exciting.
