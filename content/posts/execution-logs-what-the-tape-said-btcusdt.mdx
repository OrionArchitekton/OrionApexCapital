**Study the process, not the PnL.** Below is an anonymized log for one BTCUSDT long idea. Times are illustrative across sessions, but the structure is real.

## 1 · Hypothesis (Context first)

- **Trend frame (4H):** Uptrend with a pullback into rising EMA200; untested high sitting above liquidity pocket.
- **Level:** 4H demand with clear resting stops roughly 0.8% overhead.
- **Volatility:** 24H ATR supported a 2R move within a 72-hour window.

## 2 · Trigger (Binary checklist)

- **Confirmation:** 1H momentum slope flips positive; rejection wick at level; spread stays stable.
- **Invalidation:** Candle close below the pre-drawn 4H swing low.
- **Sizing:** ATR-anchored risk per plan, no discretionary overrides.

## 3 · Execution (Condensed log)

| Timestamp | Action | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `T+00:00` | Limit resting at level | Stop, targets, and alerts staged server-side. |
| `T+00:05` | Fill | No averaging. Risk fixed. |
| `T+00:18` | Impulse bar | Take partial at TP1 (1R); stop to breakeven. |
| `T+03:40` | Consolidation | No add; avoid optimizing a good position into chop. |
| `T+06:05` | Breakaway | Trail under structure as tape accelerates. |
| `T+20:10` | Exit | Structure break triggers final exit; log rationale. |

## 4 · Debrief (Where the learning lives)

- **What worked:** Pre-planned invalidation; no tinkering once live; clean partial at TP1.
- **What we passed on:** Temptation to add into consolidation—skipped and logged as “impulse avoided.”
- **Rule to keep:** If confirmation arrives late, pass. The first clean risk is usually the best risk.

> **Post-trade prompt:** If we experienced this setup 100 more times, what single rule protects edge every run?
