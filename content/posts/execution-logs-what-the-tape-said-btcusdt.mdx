**Study the process, not the PnL.** Below is a condensed, anonymized log for one BTCUSDT idea. Times are illustrative and aggregated across sessions.

### 1) Hypothesis
- **Context (4H):** Trend up; pullback into rising EMA200; prior high untested above.
- **Level:** 4H demand with liquidity pocket sitting ~0.8% above.
- **Volatility:** 24h ATR supportive for a 2R push within <=72h.

### 2) Trigger Conditions
- **Confirm:** Momentum slope flips positive on 1H; rejection wick at level; spread stable.
- **Invalidation:** Close below 4H swing low (pre-drawn).
- **Size:** ATR-anchored; risk fixed per plan.

### 3) Execution (Condensed Log)
- `T+00:00` Limit placed at level; stop and targets staged.
- `T+00:05` Fill; stop lives server-side; no averaging.
- `T+00:18` Impulse bar; partial at TP1 (1R); SL to BE.
- `T+03:40` Consolidation under pocket; no add -- avoid over-optimization.
- `T+06:05` Break and run; trail under structure.
- `T+20:10` Exit remainder at structure break; log reason.

### 4) Debrief
- **What worked:** Pre-planned invalidation, no tinkering mid-trade, clean partial at TP1.
- **What didn't:** Early bias to add size -- skipped (good).
- **Repeatable rule:** If confirm comes late, pass; the *first* clean risk is best.

> **Post-Trade Prompt:** "If I lived this 100 more times, what is the one rule that protects edge?"
