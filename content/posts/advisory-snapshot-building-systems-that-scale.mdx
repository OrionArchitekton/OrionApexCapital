Scale doesn't require doing more. It requires doing the **right** moves the same way every time.

## 1 · Operating cadence that removes guesswork

- **Weekly (45 min):** Focus 3, blockers, owner assignments.
- **Monthly:** Scorecard review: pipeline, conversion, cycle time, CAC payback.
- **Quarterly:** Reset bets; kill or double-down based on evidence.

## 2 · Minimalist system stack

- **Source of truth:** Single CRM plus one project board—everything else feeds into them.
- **Dashboards:** Inputs (activity quality) and outputs (revenue, retention) stay side-by-side.
- **Automation:** Alerts for SLA misses and templated recurring tasks protect consistency.

> **Operator reminder:** More tools aren’t the answer. Consistent usage is.

## 3 · Decision hygiene for compounding learning

- **Write it down:** Problem → options → chosen path → success metric.
- **Pre-mortem:** “It failed in 90 days—why?” Bake mitigations before execution.
- **Post-mortem:** Facts over feelings; document upgrades to the playbook.

## 4 · Go-to-market levers that keep compounding

- ICP clarity drives sharper messaging and higher close rates.
- Mid-funnel enablement: case studies tied to measurable outcomes.
- Nurture loops: consistent educational touchpoints—not spray-and-pray spam.

### Starter artifacts ready to deploy

- Weekly agenda template
- KPI glossary with definitions and owners
- Case study skeleton (problem → approach → outcome → proof)

**Rule:** Scale is a property of systems, not heroics.
