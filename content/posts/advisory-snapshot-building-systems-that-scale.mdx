Scale isn't about doing **more** -- it's about doing the **same right things**, more predictably.

## 1) Operating Cadence
- **Weekly:** Focus 3, blockers, and owner assignments; 45-minute cap.
- **Monthly:** Scorecard review (pipeline, conversion, cycle time, CAC payback).
- **Quarterly:** Reset bets; kill or double-down.

## 2) System Stack (minimalist)
- **Source of Truth:** One CRM + one project board.
- **Dashboards:** Inputs (activity/quality) and outputs (revenue/retention).
- **Automation:** Alerts for SLA misses; recurring tasks templated.

## 3) Decision Hygiene
- **Write It Down:** Problem -> options -> chosen path -> success metric.
- **Pre-Mortem:** "It failed in 90 days -- why?" Bake mitigations now.
- **Post-Mortem:** Facts > feelings; update checklists.

## 4) GTM Levers That Compound
- ICP clarity -> tighter messaging -> higher close rates.
- Mid-funnel enablement: case studies tied to measurable outcomes.
- Nurture loops: consistent educational touchpoints, not spam.

### Starter Artifacts (download/playbook ready)
- Weekly agenda template
- KPI glossary
- Case study skeleton (problem -> approach -> outcome -> proof)

> **Rule:** Scale is a property of systems, not heroics.
