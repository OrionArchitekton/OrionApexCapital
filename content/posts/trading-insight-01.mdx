We run every style of short-term trade through a **three-gate pre-flight** before a single unit of capital is exposed.

## Gate 1 · Structure (HTF clarity first)

- **Higher-timeframe map (4H / D):** Identify trend regime, key moving averages, and imbalance zones.
- **Level stack:** Pre-drawn swing highs/lows, session VWAP deviations, and reference opens.
- **Liquidity picture:** Seek resting stops or inefficiencies worth hunting—avoid vacuums with no incentive.

## Gate 2 · Volatility (reward has to outrun risk)

- **ATR-anchored sizing:** Position size scales inversely with range—more volatility, less size.
- **Minimum expected move:** Target at least 1.5–3.0× the stop distance within a 72-hour window.
- **Event filter:** If the playbook does not explicitly handle a macro release, we stand down.

> **Operator reminder:** Risk is a fixed budget. When volatility expands, we buy time and space, not more contracts.

## Gate 3 · Alignment (confirm or pass)

- **Momentum slope:** RSI/MACD direction matches the idea and is not diverging.
- **Session edge:** Deploy when liquidity is cleanest for the instrument; skip off-hours noise.
- **Tape feel:** Spread, speed, and depth stay orderly. Thin books equal instant veto.

### Risk Protocol that never flexes

- **2:1 minimum R:R** locked in at entry.
- **Stops to breakeven at TP1**, then trail behind structural continuation.
- **Max two concurrent themes** so focus and execution stay sharp.

### Execution hygiene

1. Document invalidation *before* the order is submitted.
2. Log every notable action with a timestamp and the reasoning (“because X, not despite Y”).
3. Weekly review separates setup quality from operator execution—only one variable changes at a time.

**Precision beats prediction.** Our job is to take *good* trades, not *all* trades.
