**Nothing here is financial advice.**

We operate a simple, repeatable checklist before committing risk. Every trade must pass **three gates**:

## 1) Structure
- **HTF Context (4H/D):** Is price trending or ranging? Where is EMA200?
- **Levels:** Pre-marked swing highs/lows, session VWAP deviations, weekly opens.
- **Liquidity:** Clear pockets of stops/inefficiencies to target; avoid vacuum zones.

## 2) Volatility
- **ATR-Anchored Sizing:** Position size scales inversely with ATR.
- **Minimum Expected Move:** >= 1.5-3.0x stop distance within <=72h window.
- **Event Filter:** Stand down into major macro prints unless the playbook explicitly handles them.

## 3) Alignment (Confirm)
- **Momentum Slope:** RSI/MACD slope aligned to trade direction.
- **Time-of-Day Edge:** Focus sessions with the cleanest impulse for the pair.
- **Tape Read:** Speed + spread stable; avoid thin books and jump risk.

### Risk Protocol
- **2:1 minimum R:R** at entry.
- **SL to BE at TP1**; trail on structure after continuation bar closes.
- **Max 2 concurrent themes**; concentration beats fragmentation.

### Execution Notes
- Pre-plan invalidation on the chart **before** order is live.
- Log each action with timestamp and reason ("because X, not despite Y").
- Review weekly: *Was it the setup or the execution?* Adjust only one variable at a time.

> **Operator Truth:** Precision beats prediction. Our job is to take good trades, not all trades.
